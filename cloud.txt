Written work is divided into paragraphs in a meaningful way. A paragraph is a group of sentences that develop one topic or idea. 
The topic of one paragraph should follow logically from the topic of the last paragraph and should lead on to the topic of the next paragraph.
The paragraphs have different functions, but all develop an idea - that is, they add information, explanation, examples and illustrations to the central theme or idea until the theme is fully developed.
